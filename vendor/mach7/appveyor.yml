  # Remove sh.exe from the path otherwise CMake will complain:

  # and the MinGW build will not work (the Visual Studio build does not care).
  # See http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/problems/3193-cmake-building-for-mingw-issue-with-git-shexe
  # The entire directory containing sh.exe could be removed from the PATH environment:
  # - set PATH=%PATH:C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin;=%
  # However, this will also remove all other programs in this directory from the PATH.
  # In particular "patch" is still required.
  # So, just rename sh.exe:
  - ren "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\sh.exe" _sh.exe
