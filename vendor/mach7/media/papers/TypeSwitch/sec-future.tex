Using a library implementation was essential for experimentation and for being able to
test our ideas on multiple production-quality compiler systems.
However, now we hope to re-implement our ideas in a compiler.
This would allow us to improve further surface syntax, diagnostics, and performance.

%In the future we would like to provide an efficient multi-threaded 
%implementation of our library as currently it relies heavily on static variables 
%and global state, which will have problems in a multi-threaded environment. 
%
%Additionally, the match statement that we presented here deals with only one 
%subject at the moment, but we believe that the same technique can be used to 
%address multiple subjects.
%
%We would also like to experiment with other kinds of cache indexing functions in 
%order to decrease the frequency of conflicts, especially those coming from the use 
%of dynamically-linked libraries.
%
%Last but not least we would like to look at providing support for alternative 
%matching semantics.
